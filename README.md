# new-responsive-web-design-certification-building-a-piano

Reviewing fundamentals of HTML and CSS via the freeCodeCamp - (New) Responsive Web Design Certification, practicing how to build webpages using HTML for content, and CSS for design.

In this exercise I built a piano, applying responsive web design to tell the webpage how it should look on different-sized screens.

I found coding the piano extremely useful to continue practicing my intermediate CSS skills, while also getting to practice using media queries, and pseudo selectors. This challenge has really helped me improve my knowledge of all the aforementioned, and continue to build on some of the knowledge I had previously.
