# new-responsive-web-design-certification-building-a-piano

Reviewing fundamentals of HTML and CSS via the freeCodeCamp - (New) Responsive Web Design Certification, practicing how to build webpages using HTML for content, and CSS for design.

In this exercise I build a piano to revisit key concepts of responsive web design which tells the webpage how it should look on different-sized screens.

I found it useful to continue practicing using CSS to code a piano, and also applied media queries, and pseudo selectors. This challenge has served to help me better grasp my knowledge of both concepts and keep building on my knowledge by practicing.
